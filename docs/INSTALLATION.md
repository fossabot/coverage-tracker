# Installation Guide

This guide walks through deploying coverage-tracker to your own Cloudflare account.
Follow the steps in order — several decisions depend on values produced by earlier steps.

---

## Prerequisites

- A **Cloudflare account** (free tier is sufficient)
- A **domain managed by Cloudflare** (DNS must be proxied through Cloudflare — see [Domain setup](#1-domain-setup) below)
- A **GitHub account** (personal or org) with admin access to the repos you want to track
- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** installed locally
- **Wrangler** authenticated: `npx wrangler login`

---

## 1. Domain setup

The Worker must be served from a domain whose DNS is managed by Cloudflare. This is required for both custom domain routing and Cloudflare Access.

If your domain's DNS is hosted elsewhere (e.g. Porkbun, Namecheap, Route 53):

1. Go to **Cloudflare dashboard → Websites → Add a domain**
2. Enter your domain → select **Free** plan
3. Cloudflare scans and imports your existing DNS records — review them
4. In your registrar's control panel, replace the nameservers with the two Cloudflare nameservers shown
5. Wait for propagation (usually minutes; Cloudflare emails you when active)

You do **not** need to manually create a DNS record for the Worker subdomain — the deploy step handles that automatically.

---

## 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/coverage-tracker
cd coverage-tracker
npm install
```

---

## 3. Create the D1 database

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create coverage-tracker
```

Copy the `database_id` from the output and paste it into `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "DB",
    "database_name": "coverage-tracker",
    "database_id": "YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE",   // ← paste here
    "migrations_dir": "migrations"
  }
]
```

Also update `WORKER_URL` in the `vars` section to the subdomain you intend to use:

```jsonc
"vars": {
  "WORKER_URL": "https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com"
}
```

And update the `routes` entry:

```jsonc
"routes": [
  { "pattern": "coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com", "custom_domain": true }
]
```

> **Note:** `custom_domain: true` tells Wrangler to create the DNS record automatically.
> Do not add a wildcard (`/*`) when using `custom_domain: true` — just the bare hostname.

---

## 4. Apply the database migration

Apply to your remote D1 database:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

---

## 5. Create the GitHub App

> **Important:** There are two separate GitHub integrations in this project:
> - A **GitHub App** (this step) — for webhook events and API access
> - A **GitHub OAuth App** (Step 8) — for Cloudflare Access dashboard login
>
> Do not conflate them. Create them separately.

Go to the account or org where you want to host the app:
- **Personal:** GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → **New GitHub App**
- **Org:** GitHub → Your org → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → **New GitHub App**

### Required fields

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| GitHub App name | Something globally unique, e.g. `your-coverage-tracker` |
| Homepage URL | `https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com` |
| Webhook → Active | ✓ checked |
| Webhook URL | `https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com/webhooks/github` |
| Webhook secret | Generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` — save this value |

### Leave these blank / unchecked

- **Callback URL** — not used (no OAuth user flow)
- **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** — leave unchecked
- **Setup URL** — leave blank

### Permissions (Repository)

| Permission | Level |
|-----------|-------|
| Metadata | Read-only *(auto-selected)* |
| Checks | Read & write |

No other permissions are needed.

### Subscribe to events

Check both:
- **Installation target**
- **Installation repositories**

### Where can this app be installed?

Select **Only on this account** for a private self-hosted instance.

### After creating

On the app's settings page, note:
- **App ID** → you'll set this as `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- **Client ID** → you'll set this as `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`

Generate a private key: scroll to **Private keys → Generate a private key**.
GitHub downloads a `.pem` file in PKCS#1 format. The Worker requires PKCS#8.

**Convert the private key** (Node.js, no OpenSSL required):

```bash
node -e "
const c = require('crypto'), fs = require('fs');
const key = c.createPrivateKey(fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1], 'utf8'));
process.stdout.write(key.export({ type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' }));
" your-app.private-key.pem > private-key-pkcs8.pem
```

Or as a one-liner piped directly into wrangler (no file written to disk):

```bash
node -e "
const c = require('crypto'), fs = require('fs');
const key = c.createPrivateKey(fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1], 'utf8'));
process.stdout.write(key.export({ type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' }));
" your-app.private-key.pem | npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
```

---

## 6. Set Wrangler secrets

Set the GitHub App credentials:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_APP_ID          # numeric App ID, e.g. 1234567
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID   # starts with "Iv23..."
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY # if not piped above
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET  # the value you generated in step 5
```

The two Cloudflare Access secrets (collect these in Steps 7–8 below, then come back):

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN  # e.g. myteam.cloudflareaccess.com
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_AUD          # AUD tag UUID from the Access app
```

---

## 7. Set up Cloudflare Zero Trust

Go to **Cloudflare dashboard → Zero Trust**.

On first visit, choose a **team name** (e.g. `myteam`). This becomes `myteam.cloudflareaccess.com` — your `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`.

---

## 8. Create a GitHub OAuth App (for dashboard login)

This is separate from the GitHub App created in Step 5. Cloudflare Access uses it to authenticate you when you visit the dashboard.

GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → **OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Application name | `coverage-tracker-access` (any name) |
| Homepage URL | `https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com` |
| Authorization callback URL | `https://myteam.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback` |

Save the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret** — you'll need both in the next step.

---

## 9. Add GitHub as an identity provider in Zero Trust

Zero Trust → **Settings → Authentication → Add new** → select **GitHub**

Enter the OAuth App's Client ID and Client Secret from Step 8.

---

## 10. Create the Cloudflare Access application

Zero Trust → **Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| App name | `coverage-tracker` |
| Session duration | Your preference (e.g. 24 hours) |
| Identity providers | GitHub (the one added in Step 9) |

**Application domain — add two entries:**

| Domain | Path |
|--------|------|
| `coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com` | `/api` |
| `coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com` | `/admin` |

> **Critical:** Protect only `/api` and `/admin`, not the whole domain.
> The `/ingest` and `/webhooks/github` routes are used by CI and GitHub respectively —
> they must not be blocked by Access. They are protected by OIDC and HMAC instead.
> The `/badge` route is intentionally public.

Add a policy:
- **Policy name:** Allow deployer
- **Action:** Allow
- **Rule:** Emails → `your-email@example.com`

After saving, open the application settings and copy the **Application Audience (AUD) Tag** — this is your `CF_ACCESS_AUD`.

Now go back and set the two Access secrets if you haven't already:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_AUD
```

---

## 11. Deploy the Worker

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Expected output:

```
Deployed coverage-tracker triggers
  coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com (custom domain)
```

The DNS record is created automatically. If you see `No targets deployed`, check that the `routes` entry in `wrangler.jsonc` uses `"custom_domain": true` and not a wildcard path.

---

## 12. Install the GitHub App on your repos

Go to your GitHub App's settings page → **Install App** → select the account or org → choose the repos you want to track (or all repos).

This fires an `installation: created` webhook to your Worker, which populates the `owners` and `projects` tables.

> **If the webhook returns 500:** Check the Worker logs with `npx wrangler tail`, fix the
> issue, clear the failed delivery from the dedup table, then redeliver:
>
> ```bash
> npx wrangler d1 execute DB --remote \
>   --command "DELETE FROM webhook_deliveries WHERE delivery_id = 'THE-DELIVERY-ID'"
> ```
>
> Then go to GitHub App → Advanced → Recent Deliveries → Redeliver.

---

## 13. Verify

Run these two queries to confirm the webhook was received and processed correctly.

**Owners table** — should show the GitHub account or org the App was installed on:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --command "SELECT * FROM owners"
```

Expected output (one row per account):

```
┌────┬───────────┬───────────┬──────────────┬────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ id │ github_id │ login     │ type         │ avatar_url │ created_at          │
├────┼───────────┼───────────┼──────────────┼────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ 1  │ 128944512 │ YourOrg   │ Organization │ https://…  │ 2026-06-24 04:09:40 │
└────┴───────────┴───────────┴──────────────┴────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

If this table is empty, the webhook was not received or failed before reaching the database. Check the Worker logs with `npx wrangler tail`, then see the troubleshooting note in Step 12.

---

**Projects table** — should show one row per registered repo:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --remote \
  --command "SELECT full_slug, default_branch, badge_enabled FROM projects"
```

Expected output:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────────┐
│ full_slug                          │ default_branch │ badge_enabled │
├────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ YourOrg/repo-one                   │ main           │ 0             │
├────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ YourOrg/repo-two                   │ main           │ 0             │
└────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

`badge_enabled` is `0` (off) by default for all repos — this is intentional. See **Next steps** for how to opt a repo into the public badge endpoint.

If the owners table has a row but projects is empty, the GitHub App was likely installed with **All repositories** selected but the webhook payload contained no repo list. Trigger a manual resync:

```bash
# Find your installation ID in the owners table output or in:
# GitHub → Your org → Settings → Third-party Access → GitHub Apps → Configure
# The installation ID is the number at the end of the URL.

curl -X POST https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com/admin/resync \
  -H "Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion: <your-access-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"installationId": YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID}'
```

If both tables have rows, the installation is complete and the Worker is ready to accept metric ingestion from CI.

---

## Next steps

- **Ingest metrics from CI:** Add a workflow to your repos that posts coverage/complexity/duplication data to `/ingest` using a GitHub Actions OIDC token. See the reporting Action docs (Phase 6).
- **Enable badges:** Opt individual repos into the public badge endpoint:
  ```bash
  # Find the project ID first
  npx wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --command "SELECT id, full_slug FROM projects"

  # Enable badge for a specific project
  curl -X PATCH https://coverage-tracker.yourdomain.com/admin/projects/1/badge \
    -H "Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion: <your-access-token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"enabled": true}'
  ```
- **Resync if repos drift:** If you add/remove repos from the GitHub App installation and the webhook is missed, trigger a manual resync via `POST /admin/resync` with `{"installationId": YOUR_INSTALLATION_ID}`.
